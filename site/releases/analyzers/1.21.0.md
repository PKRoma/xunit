Today, we're shipping two new releases:

* xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `2.0.1` ([release notes](/releases/v3/2.0.1))
* **xUnit.net Analyzers `1.20.1`**

It's been 5 weeks since the release of [`1.20.0` RTM](1.20.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a comprehensive list of changes from `1.20.0` to `1.21.0`.

### Assertion Analyzers

* **BUG:** The fixer for [xUnit2017](/xunit.analyzers/rules/xUnit2017) would always pass the comparer argument to the converted `Assert.Contains` or `Assert.DoesNotContain` call, even if the user passed `null` to the comparer. While `null` is a valid value for Linq `Contains`, it is not legal for the assertions, so the fixer will now strip the `null` during conversion. _Note: this only affects users who pass literal `null` to the `Contains` call. Passing a variable will retain the variable, and the compiler or runtime will resolve `null` issues._ [xunit/xunit#3244](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3244){: .issue-link }
