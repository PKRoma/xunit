Today, we're shipping two new releases:

* **xUnit.net Core Framework v3 `2.0.1`**
* xUnit.net Analyzers `1.21.0`([release notes](/releases/analyzers/1.21.0))

It's been 5 weeks since the release of [`2.0.0` RTM](2.0.0).

As always, we'd like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions. ðŸŽ‰

## Release Notes

These release notes are a list of changes from `2.0.0` to `2.0.1`.

### Core Framework

* We will no longer emit UTF-8 byte-order marks into reports. This should make the files more compatible with automated tooling (like the GitHub Actions action [`github-test-reporter`](https://github.com/ctrf-io/github-test-reporter)). [xunit/xunit#3224](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3224){: .issue-link }

* We have improved performance for NCrunch users by bypassing expensive JSON serialization and deserialization steps in message reporting, which was exacerbated by the use of synchronous message reporting. [xunit/xunit#3228](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3228){: .issue-link }

* We have resolved two inconsistencies when calling `IXunitSerializer`. First, when using arrays, calling `SerializationHelper.Serialize` would pass the instance of the array to `IXunitSerializer.IsSerializable`, but `SerializationHelper.IsSerializable` would not. Second, we called `IXunitSerializer.IsSerializable` twice for each element in the array when once was sufficient. [xunit/xunit#3243](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3243){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** When generating the entry point for v3 test projects, we failed to normalize the namespace to ensure it was legal. For example, if your project name used characters that weren't legal in a namespace (like a dash: `-`) and did not set `<DefaultNamespace>` in your project file to something legal, we would generate namespaces using the project name, which weren't legal. We now follow the same logic that Microsoft Testing Platform uses for namespace normalization, since we need our generated namespace to match theirs. [xunit/xunit#3241](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3241){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** When running in Microsoft Testing Platform mode, any cleanup failure messages were being silently ignored, which caused test projects to pass inappropriately. Now they are reported onto every affected test node (i.e., a test class cleanup failure will be reported as a additional failure of every test in the test class, regardless of what the original state of the test was). [xunit/xunit#3213](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3213){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We have added support for converting `Trace.Assert` and `Debug.Assert` failures into test failures. In some scenarios this used to hard-crash the test process. [xunit/xunit#3220](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3220){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue where the randomizer provided by [`Randomizer.Current`](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/245be13b61482dc807b297b3150f9ec15d087485/src/xunit.v3.common/Utility/Randomizer.cs#L25) was not thread safe. If accessed from multiple threads simultaneously, it could end up returning strings of `0` instead of random numbers. [xunit/xunit#3212](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3212){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue with `TheoryData` where a [compiler ambiguity error](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/overload-resolution#ambiguous-overloads) was thrown if it could not determine whether the data being added was raw data or theory data row data (typically for `null` values). _Note: This utilizes [`OverloadResolutionPriorityAttribute`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.overloadresolutionpriorityattribute) which is only recognized by C# 13 (and later) which ships with .NET SDK 9. If you have this compiler ambiguity, either upgrade to the latest .NET SDK or add casts to the data to resolve the ambiguity._ [xunit/xunit#3197](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3197){: .issue-link }

### Assertion Library

* We have add a new assertion: `Assert.MultipleAsync` works the same way as `Assert.Multiple`, except that the lambdas passed to the assertion are `Task`-returning (async). [xunit/xunit#3209](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3209){: .issue-link }

* **BUG:** Fixed an issue with `Assert.Equivalent` when comparing objects that had replaced properties with the `new` keyboard. [xunit/xunit#3193](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3193){: .issue-link }

### Runner Utility and Runners

* **BUG:** We fixed an issue where cleanup failure messages were thrown after finished messages. This made it impossible for developers using [`MessageMetadataCache`](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/blob/245be13b61482dc807b297b3150f9ec15d087485/src/xunit.v3.runner.common/Utility/MessageMetadataCache.cs) to acquire metadata information for the cleanup messages, which surfaced in normal use with the first party runnings saying `<unknown XYZ>` when printing "XYZ" cleanup failure information (i.e., `<unknown test class>` for `ITestClassCleanupFailure`). [xunit/xunit#3221](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/3221){: .issue-link }

### NuGet Packages

* The `xunit.v3.assert` package should no longer include dependencies on `System.Collections.Immutable` or `System.Memory` for users targeting .NET 8+, as the versions included in the framework itself are sufficient.
